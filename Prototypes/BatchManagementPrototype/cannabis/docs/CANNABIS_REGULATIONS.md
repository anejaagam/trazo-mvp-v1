# Cannabis Cultivation Regulations & Compliance Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the marijuana/cannabis cultivation regulations and compliance requirements implemented in the Batch Management System. The system is designed to maintain full compliance with state cannabis regulations and Metrc (Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Reporting Compliance) requirements.

---

## 1. Metrc Compliance Requirements

### What is Metrc?
Metrc is the state-mandated seed-to-sale tracking system used by cannabis regulatory agencies to track commercial cannabis activity. All licensed cannabis businesses must report their inventory and activities to Metrc in real-time.

### Metrc Reporting Requirements
- **Real-time Inventory Tracking**: All plant movements, harvests, and waste must be reported
- **Plant Tag Assignment**: Each flowering plant must have a unique Metrc-compliant RFID tag
- **Batch/Package Creation**: All products must be entered into Metrc with proper weights and testing data
- **Waste Reporting**: All cannabis waste must be documented with reason, weight, and disposal method
- **Transfer Manifests**: All product movements between licensed facilities must be tracked

### Data Required for Metrc
- Plant tag numbers (unique identifiers)
- Strain name and type
- Growth stage (immature, vegetative, flowering)
- Location (room/zone)
- Weights (wet weight at harvest, dry weight after processing)
- Destruction/waste records with authorization

---

## 2. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

### SOP-001: Plant Tagging Protocol
**Purpose**: Ensure all flowering cannabis plants are properly tagged with Metrc-compliant RFID tags before entering the flowering stage.

**Requirements**:
- Tag plants before transitioning from vegetative to flowering stage
- Record tag number, plant ID, strain, and date in system
- Report tagging session to Metrc within 24 hours
- Document any tag failures or replacements
- Maintain inventory of available tags

**Process**:
1. Count plants ready for flowering transition
2. Verify available tag inventory
3. Physically attach RFID tags to plants
4. Scan and record each tag number
5. Sync data to Metrc
6. Update batch stage to "flowering"

### SOP-002: Harvest & Batching Protocol
**Purpose**: Document harvest activities and create compliant product batches for post-harvest processing.

**Requirements**:
- Record wet weight at time of harvest (in grams)
- Document harvest date and time
- Record harvesting personnel
- Identify plants harvested by tag number
- Assign batch identification numbers
- Report harvest data to Metrc
- Move product to designated drying area

**Process**:
1. Select plants ready for harvest (based on flowering time)
2. Document pre-harvest plant count and tag numbers
3. Harvest and weigh wet flower material
4. Create harvest batch in system
5. Report to Metrc with all required data
6. Transfer to drying room with batch documentation
7. Update plant status to "harvested" in Metrc

### SOP-003: Waste Disposal Protocol
**Purpose**: Ensure all cannabis waste is properly documented, rendered unusable, and disposed of in compliance with state regulations.

**Requirements**:
- Document waste type, weight, and reason for disposal
- Require approval from compliance manager before disposal
- Mix cannabis waste with non-cannabis material (50%+ non-cannabis)
- Report all waste to Metrc before disposal
- Maintain photographic evidence of waste disposal
- Record disposal date, method, and authorized personnel

**Cannabis-Specific Waste Categories**:

- Failed heavy metals testing
- Spider mites infestation
- Aphids infestation
- Thrips infestation
- Root rot damaged plants
- Nutrient burn damaged plants
- Light stress damage
- Trim waste (sugar leaves)
- Stems and stalks
- Fan leaves
- Root material

**Process**:
1. Identify waste material and reason
2. Weigh waste accurately (in grams)
3. Submit waste log for compliance approval
4. Upon approval, mix with non-cannabis waste material
5. Document mixing process with photos
6. Report to Metrc
7. Dispose per local regulations
8. Archive all documentation for audit trail

## 3. Plant Count & Tracking Regulations

### Immature Plant Lots
**Definition**: Cannabis plants that have not yet entered the flowering stage (clones, seedlings, vegetative plants).

**Regulations**:
- Can be tracked in groups/lots rather than individually
- Maximum of 100 plants per immature lot
- Must transition to individual tracking before flowering
- Lot must have unique identifier in Metrc
- All plants in lot must be same strain
- Count verification required during state inspections

### Individual Flowering Plants
**Definition**: Cannabis plants that have entered the flowering/bloom stage.

**Regulations**:
- **MUST** be individually tagged with Metrc RFID tags
- Each plant requires unique plant tag number
- Tag must remain with plant through harvest
- Any plant death or destruction must be reported individually
- Tag must be returned to Metrc after harvest/destruction

### Plant Count Limits
- License type determines maximum plant count
- Cultivator licenses typically allow 100-10,000+ plants depending on tier
- Regular plant count audits required (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- Discrepancies must be reported to state regulators
- Over-count violations result in fines or license suspension
